Might be user's fault because of bad keys pressed during VMware power-on init.  Might be fixed by $LK,"ACf_INIT_IN_PROGRESS",A="MN:ACf_INIT_IN_PROGRESS"$.

* 1/12/16 $LK,"ATARepEntry",A="MN:ATARepEntry"$ shows corrupted bttns.  Weird.  Perhaps, my imagination.

$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Committee Needed"$$FG$
* Make binary tree look-up using FUN_SEG symbol addresses, so we can eliminate fun_seg cache and wall-paper kludge?  All HolyC functions and glbl vars would have left-right for address search.
